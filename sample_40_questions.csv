In this AntiPattern, it is possible to identify one or more ghostlike apparition classes that appear only briefly to initiate some action in another more permanent class.","Boat Anchor,Poltergeist,Dead end,Input Kludge",1
"A __________ is a piece of software or hardware that serves no useful purpose on the current project. Often is a costly acquisition, which makes the purchase even more ironic.","Bolb,Lava Flow,Boat Anchor,Poltergeist",2
"A software development team has gained a high level of competence in a particular solution or vendor product, referred to here as the __________. ","Bolb,Poltergeist,Dead End,Golden Hammer",3
"This AntiPattern results in the misapplication of a favored tool or concept. Developers and managers are comfortable with an existing approach and unwilling to learn and apply one that is better suited.","Golden Hammer,Boat Anchor,Poltergeist,Lava Flow",0
"A _________ is reached by modifying a reusable component, if the modified component is no longer maintained and supported by the supplier. When these modifications are made, the support burden transfers to the application system developers and maintainers.","Poltergeist,Lava Flow,Dead End,Input Kludge",2
"Nonobject-oriented languages appear to be more susceptible to this AntiPattern, but it is fairly common among developers who have yet to fully master the advanced concepts underlying object orientation.","Spaghetti Code,Bolb,Lava Flow,Golden Hammer",0

"This AntiPattern is the result of experienced, nonobject-oriented developers who design and implement an application in an object-oriented language.
